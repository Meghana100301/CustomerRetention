# CustomerRetention

CustomerRetention automates the task of finding the customers who would churn an organisation in the near future. The bankcustomerschurn dataset is used and the customers who would leave a bank are predicted by a model. 

Data Cleaning tasks are performed, model is built, predictions are made and the accuracy of the model is determined.
